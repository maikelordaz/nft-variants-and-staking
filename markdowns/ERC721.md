## How does ERC721A save gas? And where does it add cost?

If an NFT is transferred to a contract it can be used the `safetransferFrom` function, using the param `data` this data has to be decoded by the contract to know what to do with the NFT. This way it can be skipped the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions, and give a better user experience, but it adds more complexity in the front-end side. But this pattern adds gas costs if the receiver is an EOA, is better to use `transferFrom`.
